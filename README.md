##Rectangle Class

This is an exercise I did to practice writing a class in Ruby from scratch.

The class initialize method requires width as an argument, and accepts height optionally. If height is not specified, it will instantiate as a square (four equal sides).

Included within the class, are a number of methods that return information about the inputed rectangle.

Writing this code also gave me a chance to practice:

* Keeping track of a class instance's attributes
* Using an `attr_reader` to access an object's attributes
* Writing a method that uses a class instance's state to make a calculation
